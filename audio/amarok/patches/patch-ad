commit 7dbec1171386f182be77942ae43dc3684a96cfc4
Author: Mark Kretschmann <kretschmann@kde.org>

    Better workaround for wrong applet size on startup.

    This version also works in the case that Amarok was hidden to
    tray before starting, and it does not produce a jerking motion
    when starting in fullscreen mode.
    Thanks to Felix Geyer <debfx-pkg@fobos.de> for the idea.

    It might worth to include this patch in Amarok packages.
