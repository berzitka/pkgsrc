Please note that the
${SECCGIDIR}
directory has been created with all permissions removed for security
reasons. Check what the scripts do and enable those that are useful to you
and of acceptable security impact.

Please also note that anything beyond the xymon front page (eg cpu reports,
which contain top output) are a privacy concern and also a potential
excessive information disclosure concern, so you may want to restrict
access to authenticated users.
