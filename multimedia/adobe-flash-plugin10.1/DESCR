Netscape plugin for Adobe Flash player.  This package contains
a plugin that enables web browsers to render the Flash format.

The nspluginwrapper option (enabled by default) permits the use of
the the Linux x86 flash player in Firefox browsers on other x86
systems.

This package requires emul.linux.kern.osrelease = 2.6.18 or later.
This means this package won't work on NetBSD 5.x or older systems!

WARNING!
The flash plugin *really* requires this step beacuse of PulseAudio:

Some Linux binaries require tmpfs to be mounted on /dev/shm.
This can be automated by adding the following to your /etc/fstab:

tmpfs /emul/linux/dev/shm tmpfs rw,-m1777
