Execute these commands to extract and rehash all CA root certificates
distributed by the Mozilla Project, so that they can be used by third
party applications using OpenSSL:

	# cd /etc/openssl/certs # Default SSLCERTS path for NetBSD
	# mozilla-rootcerts extract
	# mozilla-rootcerts rehash

To create a single file certificate bundle in PEM format which can
be used by applications using GnuTLS, do the following:

	# mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs
	# cd /etc/ssl/certs
	# cat ../../openssl/certs/*.pem >ca-certificates.crt
