# GNOME/KDE desktop icon and related bits

#
# Some notes on the build issues, for the benefit of the next person
# hacking this package:
#
# - The build directory must be a subdir of the Amaya dir of the
# distribution. If it isn't, the build breaks. Hence CONFIGURE_DIRS.
#
# - The copy of libwww that comes in the distfile is required; it is
# custom-patched in unspecified ways. The copy of expat in that copy
# of libwww is also custom-patched. This means we need to use that
# expat and not the pkgsrc one, which is problematic because wxWidgets
# also uses expat.
#
# - The build system is incapable of building that libwww without
# help; if the libwww subdir of the build directory does not exist,
# the makefiles won't create it, and it's not created by the configure
# script. Thus the manual invocation of make libwww_config in
# post-configure.
#
# - The distfile contains not just one but multiple included copies of
# various basic libraries (libpng, libjpeg, zlib, expat) and for the
# most part we don't want to use those copies, because they're out of
# date. It is like pulling teeth - you have to patch all over the
# place, even though the configure script ostensibly supports using
# the system versions.
#
# - For now I'm using the included copy of wxWidgets, because the
# pkgsrc copy is too old. This has a couple of its own issues, but,
# once one forcibly persuades the Amaya configure script to configure
# it correctly, isn't a big problem.
#
# - The code using redland does not work, even using the copy of
# redland included in the distfile. The schemas it tries to build are
# syntactically invalid. It *might* be a simple problem, I don't know
# enough about that stuff to fix it. Maybe someone else does.
#
# - The DAV code does not build. It requires generated files from a
# later part of the build to already exist when it's compiled. I don't
# know if it also must come before that part of the build, but it
# wouldn't entirely surprise me if it did; between this and the libwww
# issue it's clear that whoever develops this thing never tries
# building a clean tree. By the time I got to this I was tired of the
# lossage and just disabled the DAV code entirely.
#
# - The build target is "all". This is not the default. The default
# build target (if you just run make) also sort of builds the package
# but doesn't actually work.
#
# - The makefiles link some of the internal portions of the program
# using -l/-L, and some by explicitly listing .a files. The pkgsrc
# wrappers reorder these and break the build. I patched the makefiles
# to always explicitly name .a files for internal program pieces.
